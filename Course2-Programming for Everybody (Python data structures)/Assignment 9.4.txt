9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

Code:
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

words = list()
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    line = line.split()
    words.append(line[1])
    
counts = dict()
for word in words:
    counts[word]=counts.get(word,0)+1
    
maxVal=	None
maxkey = None
for key,val in counts.items():
    if val>maxVal:
        maxVal=val
        maxkey=key
        
print (maxkey,maxVal)
